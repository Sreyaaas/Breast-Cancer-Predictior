# Breast Cancer Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting breast cancer in patients. The dataset used for training and testing the model is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset, which can be found on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)).

## Installation

To run this project, you will need to install the following Python packages:

* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib
* seaborn

You can install these packages using pip:


## Usage

To run the project, simply run the `breast_cancer_prediction.py` script:


This will load the dataset, preprocess the data, split it into training and testing sets, and train a machine learning model to predict breast cancer. The model will be evaluated on the testing set and its performance will be printed to the console.

## Results

The trained model achieves an accuracy of 96% on the testing set, indicating that it is effective at predicting breast cancer in patients.
