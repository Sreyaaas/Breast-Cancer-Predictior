# Heart Disease Prediction

This project is a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of a patient having heart disease based on several input features. The model was trained on a dataset of patient information and tested for accuracy.

## Getting Started

To use this model, you will need to have Python installed on your machine, along with the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip. Once you have the necessary libraries, you can run the `predict.py` script to make a prediction on a new patient. 

The script takes in several input parameters, including age, sex, cholesterol level, and blood pressure, among others. It then uses the pre-trained machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease. 

## Model Accuracy

The machine learning model used in this project achieved an accuracy of 85% on the test data. However, it's important to note that this model is not a substitute for professional medical advice and should not be used to make medical decisions.

## Data Source

The dataset used to train the machine learning model was obtained from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease).
